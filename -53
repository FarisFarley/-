The time for the prayer became due but the Prophet (ﷺ) did not turn up; Bilal pronounced the Adhan (i.e. call) for the prayer but the Prophet (ﷺ) did not turn up, so Bilal went to Abu Bakr and said, \"The time for the prayer is due and the Prophet (ﷺ) i detained, would you lead the people in the prayer?\" Abu Bakr replied, \"Yes, you wish.\" So, Bilal pronounced the Iqama of the prayer and Abu Bakr went ahead (to lead the prayer), but the Prophet came walking among the rows till he joined the first row. The people started clapping and they clapped too much, and Abu Bakr used not to look hither and thither in the prayer, but he turned round and saw the Prophet (ﷺ) standing behind him. The Prophet (ﷺ) beckoned him with his hand to keep on praying where he was. Abu Bakr raised his hand and praised Allah and then retreated till he came in the (first) row, and the Prophet (ﷺ) went ahead and lead the people in the prayer. When the Prophet (ﷺ) finished the prayer, he turned towards the people and said, \"O people! When something happens to you during the prayer, you start clapping. Really clapping is (permissible) for women only. If something happens to one of you in his prayer, he should say: 'Subhan Allah', (Glorified be Allah), for whoever hears him (saying so) will direct his attention towards him. O Abu Bakr! What prevented you from leading the people in the prayer when I beckoned to you (to continue)?\" Abu Bakr replied, \"It did not befit the son of Abu Quhafa to lead the prayer in front of the Prophet."

The smell of the donkey of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) is better than your smell.\" On that a man from Abdullah's tribe got angry for Abdullah's sake, and the two men abused each other which caused the friends of the two men to get angry, and the two groups started fighting with sticks, shoes and hands. We were informed that the following Divine Verse was revealed (in this concern):-- \"And if two groups of Believers fall to fighting then, make peace between them.\" (49.9)"

They said, \"We will not agree to this, for if we believed that you are Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) we would not prevent you, but you are Muhammad bin Abdullah.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"I am Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and also Muhammad bin Abdullah.\" Then he said to `Ali, \"Rub off (the words) 'Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)' \", but `Ali said, \"No, by Allah, I will never rub off your name.\" So, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) took the document and wrote, 'This is what Muhammad bin Abdullah has agreed upon: No arms will be brought into Mecca except in their cases, and nobody from the people of Mecca will be allowed to go with him (i.e. the Prophet (ﷺ) ) even if he wished to follow him and he (the Prophet (ﷺ) ) will not prevent any of his companions from staying in Mecca if the latter wants to stay.' When the Prophet (ﷺ) entered Mecca and the time limit passed, the Meccans went to `Ali and said, \"Tell your Friend (i.e. the Prophet (ﷺ) ) to go out, as the period (agreed to) has passed.\" So, the Prophet (ﷺ) went out of Mecca. The daughter of Hamza ran after them (i.e. the Prophet (ﷺ) and his companions), calling, \"O Uncle! O Uncle!\" `Ali received her and led her by the hand and said to Fatima, \"Take your uncle's daughter.\" Zaid and Ja`far quarreled about her. `Ali said, \"I have more right to her as she is my uncle's daughter.\" Ja`far said, \"She is my uncle's daughter, and her aunt is my wife.\" Zaid said, \"She is my brother's daughter.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) judged that she should be given to her aunt, and said that the aunt was like the mother. He then said to 'All, \"You are from me and I am from you\", and said to Ja`far, \"You resemble me both in character and appearance\", and said to Zaid, \"You are our brother (in faith) and our freed slave.\""
