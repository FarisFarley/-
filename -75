When dust raised by the donkey covered the gathering, Abdullah bin Ubai covered his nose with his upper garment and said, \"Do not trouble us with dust.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) greeted them, stopped and dismounted. Then he invited them to Allah (i.e., to embrace Islam) and recited to them some verses of the Holy Qur'an. On that, Abdullah bin Ubai said, \"O man ! There is nothing better than what you say if it is true. Do not trouble us with it in our gathering, but return to your house, and if somebody comes to you, teach him there.\" On that Abdullah bin Rawaha said, Yes, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Bring your teachings to our gathering, for we love that.\" So the Muslims, the pagans and the Jews started abusing each other till they were about to fight. The Prophet (ﷺ) kept on quietening them till they became calm. Thereupon the Prophet mounted his animal and proceeded till he entered upon Sa`d bin Ubada. He said to him \"O Sa`d!

We visited him for the second time while he was building a wall. He said, A Muslim is rewarded (in the Hereafter) for whatever he spends except for something that he spends on building.\""
