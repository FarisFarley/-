Abdullah bin Abu Bakr. who was a young intelligent man. used to stay with them at night and leave before dawn so that in the morning, he would he with the Quraish at Mecca as if he had spent the night among them. If he heard of any plot contrived by the Quraish against the Prophet and Abu Bakr, he would understand it and (return to) inform them of it when it became dark. 'Amir bin Fuhaira, the freed slave of Abu Bakr used to graze a flock of milch sheep for them and he used to take those sheep to them when an hour had passed after the `Isha prayer. They would sleep soundly till 'Amir bin Fuhaira awakened them when it was still dark. He used to do that in each of those three nights."

Once there was some dispute between me and my wife and she answered me back in a loud voice. I said to her, 'Strange! You can retort in this way?' She said, 'Yes. Do you say this to me while your daughter troubles Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)?' So I went to Hafsa and said to her, 'I warn you not to disobey Allah and His Apostle.' I first went to Hafsa and then to Um Salama and told her the same. She said to me, 'O Umar! It surprises me that you interfere in our affairs so much that you would poke your nose even into the affairs of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and his wives.' So she rejected my advice. There was an Ansari man; whenever he was absent from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and I was present there, I used to convey to him what had happened (on that day), and when I was absent and he was present there, he used to convey to me what had happened as regards news from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) . During that time all the rulers of the nearby lands had surrendered to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) except the king of Ghassan in Sham, and we were afraid that he might attack us. All of a sudden the Ansari came and said, 'A great event has happened!' I asked him, 'What is it? Has the Ghassani (king) come?' He said, 'Greater than that! Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) has divorced his wives! I went to them and found all of them weeping in their dwellings, and the Prophet (ﷺ) had ascended to an upper room of his. At the door of the room there was a slave to whom I went and said, \"Ask the permission for me to enter.\" He admitted me and I entered to see the Prophet (ﷺ) lying on a mat that had left its imprint on his side. Under his head there was a leather pillow stuffed with palm fires. Behold! There were some hides hanging there and some grass for tanning. Then I mentioned what I had said to Hafsa and Um Salama and what reply Um Salama had given me. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) smiled and stayed there for twenty nine days and then came down.\" (See Hadith No. 648, Vol. 3 for details)"
